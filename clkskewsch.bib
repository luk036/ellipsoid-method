	abstract = {Design decisions made during high-level synthesis usually have great impacts on the later design stages. In this paper, We present a general framework, which plans for the clock skew-scheduling in physical design stages during register binding in high-level synthesis. Our proposed technique pursues the optimality of the native objective functions of the register binding problem. At the same time, it ensures not invalidating the subsequent clock skew scheduling for optimizing the clock period. We use the switching power as the native objective of our register binding problem. The problem is first formulated as a MILP problem. An acceleration scheme based on the concept of weakly compatible edge set (WCES) is proposed to speed up the MILP solver to obtain the optimal solution. Then, we present our heuristic algorithm to reduce the running time further. The experimental results show that on average our acceleration scheme can speed up the solver by 8.6 times, and our heuristic is 70 times faster than the solver with a 5.25\% degradation of the native objective. The minimum and maximum degradation among our benchmark set are 0.82\% and 12.2\%, respectively.},

The scalability of the proposed method is superior compared to conventional non-zero clock skew scheduling techniques due to the reduction of analyzed circuit sizes (partition sizes) at each iteration step and the potential to parallelize the analyses of these partitions. It is demonstrated that after only the first iteration step of the proposed method, feasible clock schedules for 65\% of the ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits are computed.

	abstract = {In the most general form, clock skew scheduling (CSS) generates a dedicated clock delay for each individual sequential component in the clock distribution network in order to minimize the clock period. Multidomain CSS (MDCSS) relieves this requirement. Instead, sequential components are grouped into several clusters (called clock domains), each of which has a uniform clock delay for all registers within that domain. The skew values of clock domains are provided by a set of deskew buffers with electrically programmable phase shifts and injected after the chip is manufactured. This technique is attractive since, due to process variations, it is becoming overwhelmingly difficult to create precise clock network delays for all sequential elements in a design globally. In this paper, we present a fast algorithm for determining the minimum number of clock domains to be used by MDCSS. The exact solution to this problem cannot be found within a reasonable time if the number of clock domains increases beyond three domains. We show that, even with a small-size circuit, in order to obtain the minimum clock period, more than three clock domains may be required. Therefore, a fast heuristic algorithm is needed to identify these domains. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first efficient heuristic algorithm for this problem. For large benchmark circuits, we solve the problem within 14.7 min on average (as high as 31.7 min for the worst case), while a commercial mixed-integer linear program solver cannot finish in over 5 h. Furthermore, our results show that, for 19 out of 21 small- and medium-size benchmarks, our algorithm yields the optimal solution.},

First, an optimal clock scheduling algorithm has been developed to allocate the slack for each path according to its timing uncertainty. To balance the skew that can be caused by process variations, programmable delay elements are inserted at the clock inputs of a small set of flip-flops on the timing critical paths. A delay-fault testing scheme combined with linear programming is used to identify and eliminate timing violations in the manufactured chips. Experimental results show that our methodology achieves substantial yield improvement over a traditional clock scheduling algorithm in many of the ISCAS89 benchmark circuits, and obtain an average yield improvement of 13.6\%.},

The new algorithm is based on the parametric shortest paths algorithm by Young, Tarjan and Orlin. It extracts the sequential timing graph only partly, that is in the critical regions, through a call back. It is still guaranteed that the algorithm finds the critical cycle and the minimum clock period. As additional input the algorithm only requires for every register the maximum delay of any outgoing combinational path. Computing these maximum delays for all the registers is equivalent to the timing analysis problem, hence they can be computed very efficiently. Computational results on recently released public benchmarks and industrial designs show that in average only 20.0 \% of the edges in the sequential graph need to be extracted and this reduces the overall runtime to 5.8 \%},

The limitation still exists even if clock skew scheduling is employed, since the amount of skew that can be assigned is practically limited due to process variations. The problem of allocating pulse width (out of discrete number of predefined widths) and scheduling clock skew (within prescribed upper bound) is formulated, for the first time, for optimizing pulsed latch-based sequential circuits. An allocation algorithm called PWCS\_Optimize is proposed to solve the problem. Experiments with 65-nm technology demonstrate that small number of variety of pulse widths (up to 5) combined with clock skews (up to 10\% of clock period) yield minimum clock period for many benchmark circuits.

In this paper we present an algorithm for constrained clock skew scheduling which computes for a given number of clocking domains the optimal phase shifts for the domains and the assignment of the individual registers to the domains.

	abstract = {Clock skew scheduling has been traditionally considered as a tool for improving the clock period in a sequential circuit. Timing slack is "stolen" from fast combinational blocks to be used by slower blocks to meet a more stringent clock cycle time. Instead, we can leverage on the borrowed time to achieve leakage power reduction during gate sizing and/or dual Vth assignment. In this paper, we present the first approach to the best of our knowledge for integrating clock skew scheduling, threshold voltage assignment, and gate sizing into one optimization formulation. Over 29 circuits in the ISCAS89 benchmark suite, this integrated approach can reduce leakage power by as much as 55.83\% and by 18.79\% on average, compared to using combinational circuit based power optimization on each combinational block without considering clock skews. Using a 65 nm dual Vth technology library, this corresponds to a 23.87\% peak reduction (6.15\% on average) in total power at the ambient operating temperature. The average total power reduction further increases to 9.83\% if the high temperature library of the same process technology is used.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of finding an optimal clock schedule, i.e.
optimal arrival times for clock signals at latches of a VLSI chip. We
describe a general model which includes all previously considered
models. Then we show how to optimize the cycle time and optimally
balance slacks on data paths and on clocktree paths. The problem of
finding a clock schedule with the optimum cycle time was solved before,
either by linear programming or by binary search, using a test for
negative circuits in a digraph as a subroutine. We show for the first
time that a direct combinatorial algorithm solves this problem
optimally. Incidentally, this yields a new efficient method for timing
analysis with transparent latches. Moreover, we extend this algorithm to
the slack balancing problem: To make the chip less sensitive to routing
detours, process variations and manufacturing skew it is desirable to
have as few critical paths as possible. We show how to find the clock
schedule with minimum number of critical paths (optimum slack
distribution) in a well-defined sense. Rather than fixed dock arrival
times we show how to obtain as large as possible intervals for the clock
arrival times. This can be considered as slack on clocktree paths.
Indeed, we can find the global optimum of simultaneous optimization of
slacks on all data paths and clocktree paths. All the above is done by
very efficient network optimization algorithms, based on parametric
shortest paths. Our computational results with recent IBM processor
chips show that the number of critical paths decreases dramatically, in
addition to a considerable improvement of the cycle time. The running
times are reasonable even for the largest designs},

optimal set of clock path delays for designing high performance
VLSI/ULSI-based clock distribution networks. This methodology emphasizes
the use of non-zero clock skew to reduce the system-wide minimum clock

previously recognized as an optimization technique for reducing the
minimum clock period, difficulty in controlling the delays of the clock
paths due to process parameter variations has limited its effectiveness.
In this paper the minimum clock period is reduced using intentional
clock skew by calculating a permissible clock skew range for each local
data path while incorporating process dependent delay values of the
clock signal paths. Graph-based algorithms are presented for determining
the minimum clock period and for selecting a range of process tolerant
clock skews for each local data path in the circuit, respectively. These
algorithms have been demonstrated on the ISCAS-89 suite of circuits.
Furthermore, examples of clock distribution networks with intentional
clock skew are shown to tolerate worst case clock skew variations of up
to 30\% without causing circuit failure while increasing the system-wide
maximum clock frequency by up to 20\% over zero skew-based systems},

skew schedule for a synchronous VLSI circuit. A novel formulation of
clock skew scheduling as a constrained quadratic programming (QP)
problem is introduced. The concept of a permissible range, or a valid
interval, for the clock skew of each local data path is key to this QP
approach. From a reliability perspective, the ideal clock schedule
corresponds to each clock skew within the circuit being at the center of
the respective permissible range. However, this ideal clock schedule is
nor practically implementable because of limitations imposed by the
connectivity among the registers within the circuit. To evaluate the
reliability, a quadratic cost function is introduced as the Euclidean
distance between the ideal schedule and a given practically feasible
clock schedule. This cost function is the minimization objective of the
described algorithms for the solution of the previously mentioned
quadratic program. Furthermore, the work described here substantially
differs from previous research in that it permits complete control over
specific clock signal delays or skews within the circuit. Specifically,
the algorithms described here can be employed to obtain results with
explicitly specified target values of important clock delays/skews with
