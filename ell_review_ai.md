# Introduction

The ellipsoid method is widely believed to be inefficient in practice for large-scale problems. The convergent rate is slow, even when using deep cuts, and it cannot exploit sparsity. As a result, it has been supplanted by the interior-point methods and is used only as a theoretical tool to prove polynomial-time solvability of some combinatorial optimization problems.

However, the ellipsoid method can be effective in problems where the number of design variables is moderate, such as ECO flow, analog circuit sizing, and parametric problems. It can also be effective in problems where the number of constraints is large, or even infinite. Additionally, the oracle can be implemented effectively.

The ellipsoid method works very differently compared with the interior point method. It requires only a separation oracle and can work nicely with other techniques. While the ellipsoid method itself cannot take advantage of sparsity, the oracle can. On the other hand, the interior point method is a more efficient algorithm for solving large-scale linear and nonlinear programming problems. It works by solving a sequence of barrier subproblems, which involves adding a logarithmic barrier function to the objective function and solving the resulting unconstrained problem using Newton's method.

## Cutting-plane

The cutting-plane method works as follows:

1. Start with a large search space S that covers the feasible region K.
2. Use a cutting plane oracle Î© to generate a linear inequality that cuts off a part of S that is not feasible.
3. Add the generated inequality to the set of constraints and update S to be the intersection of the previous S with the new constraint.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the optimal solution is found or a stopping criterion is met.

The cutting-plane oracle Î© is a subroutine that generates a linear inequality that cuts off a part of S that is not feasible.

## ðŸªœ Parallel Cut

### why parallel cut is important?

Parallel cut is important in determining the feasibility of a linear system using the Ellipsoid Algorithm. It is a technique that helps reduce the volume of the ellipsoid in each iteration of the algorithm, leading to a more efficient and accurate solution.

When applying the Ellipsoid Algorithm with parallel cuts, the distance between the parallel cuts under consideration and the corresponding radius of the current ellipsoid is taken into account. If this ratio is less than or equal to a certain constant, known as the "canonical case", the algorithm is applied to decrease the volume of the next ellipsoid by a factor that is at worst exp(â€” +5)[2].

In cases where the ratio does not meet the canonical case criteria, a noncanonical case, the algorithm adds an extra constraint to make it a canonical case in a higher-dimensional space. After applying the algorithm to this canonical case, it is then reduced back to the original space[2].

The use of parallel cuts in the algorithm helps improve its robustness and simplicity[2]. It allows for more flexibility by considering different variants of the algorithm[1]. By reducing the volume of the ellipsoid effectively, parallel cuts contribute to the efficiency of determining the feasibility of a linear system using the Ellipsoid Algorithm[2].
