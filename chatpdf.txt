The paper addresses the issue of profit maximization for firms by presenting a robust geometric programming approach to profit maximization with interval uncertainty. The authors consider the known Cobb-Douglas production function and present an approximate equivalent of the robust counterpart using piecewise convex linear approximations, which is in the form of a geometric programming problem. The impact of uncertainties is demonstrated through an example.

Interval uncertainties refer to the uncertainties in the model parameters that are represented as intervals. In this study, the authors consider interval uncertainties on the parameters of the model. They present upper and lower piecewise convex linear approximations of the robust counterpart that are efficiently solvable using interior point methods. These approximations are used to incorporate the interval uncertainties into the model.

The Cobb-Douglas production function is a well-known function used to model the relationship between inputs and outputs in production. In this study, the authors consider the profit-maximization problem with the known Cobb-Douglas production function. Its equivalent geometric programming form is given.
